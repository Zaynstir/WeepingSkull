# WeepingSkull
Motion Tracking Skull that follows you on a servo motor when you aren't looking at it.

This project required the use of a raspberry pi 3 sending commands to a servo motor that was attached to a prop skull.

Notice: I did not create the majority of this project. I took several projects that Adrian Rosebrock created and mashed them together along with modifying/re-writing to fit the needs that I wanted to do with this project.
